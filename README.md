The first test work in C#
This repository was created to test my skills acquired in the 1st quarter of my training. The task for checking the names sounds like this: Write a program that, from an existing array of strings, forms a new array of strings whose length is less than or equal to 3 characters. The initial array can be entered from the keyboard, or set at the start of the algorithm execution. When solving, it is not recommended to use collections, it is better to do exclusively with arrays. 
Examples:[“Hello”, “2”, “world”, “:-)”] → [“2”, “:-)”]
[“1234”, “1567”, “-2”, “computer science”] → [“-2”]
[“Russia”, “Denmark”, “Kazan”] → []
